# Solo Orchestrator Backlog

Items that aren't formal-spec-worthy yet — proposals, tech debt, audits, drift-watches.
Promote to `docs/superpowers/specs/` when ready to design in depth.

## Format

Each item has an ID, title, logged date, severity, short description (3–5 lines),
trigger/deadline if any, and status.

**Categories:**
- **Proposal** — new feature suggested but not yet designed
- **Debt** — known suboptimal state we're living with
- **Audit** — things to check periodically
- **Drift-watch** — things that could silently break when upstream/environment changes

**Status values:** `open` / `in-progress` / `promoted-to-spec` / `resolved` / `wontfix`.

When an item is promoted to a full spec, leave the entry here with status `promoted-to-spec` and link the spec file — don't delete; the backlog is also an audit trail of what we considered.

## BL-001: Audit downstream sync mechanism for CDF updates

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Audit
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

Existing downstream projects at older CDF `FRAMEWORK_VERSION` need a sync mechanism to pick up upstream fixes. `scripts/upgrade-project.sh` is presumed to handle this, but if its CDF-sync logic is stale, silently skips, or doesn't update `.claude/framework/` files, downstream projects miss landed fixes — e.g., FRAMEWORK_VERSION 4.2.2's Context7 detection and stop-checklist `--no-merges`/`CURRENT_HAS_SOURCE` improvements.

**Scope:** read `upgrade-project.sh`'s CDF handling; verify it pulls fresh CDF clone; verify it replaces `.claude/framework/` files correctly; verify `FRAMEWORK_VERSION` is updated in the downstream project; add regression test in `tests/upgrade-path-tests.sh`; document user-facing invocation in `docs/user-guide.md`.

**Trigger:** Before the next major CDF upstream fix that downstream projects need to pick up, OR after a downstream project reports missing a fix.

**Related:** CDF upstream commits `a640ba8`, `fd8469a`, and `4.2.2`-era changes; solo-orchestrator's BUG-001 and BUG-007 "Superseded" updates.

## BL-002: Handle GitHub free-tier branch-protection 403 gracefully

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Debt
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

Surfaced during live-API verification of the host-aware repo gate. On free-tier GitHub personal accounts, branch protection is unavailable on private repos (API returns HTTP 403 *"Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature."*). The current GitHub driver fails hard: `host_configure_protection` returns non-zero, the init.sh flow aborts, and the user gets a cryptic "failed to configure protection" message without the tier context.

**Scope:** In `scripts/host-drivers/github.sh`, detect the specific 403 response body mentioning "Upgrade to GitHub Pro" and:
1. Print a clear remediation message explaining the tier limitation (upgrade to Pro / use public / accept risk).
2. Offer to fall back to an attestation-style flow matching the `other` host path (user confirms they'll configure protection manually when they have Pro).
3. Record the attestation in `process-state.json` so the backstop gate can recognize it.

Similar check for GitLab and Bitbucket tier restrictions if their equivalent exists (GitLab's free tier allows branch protection on all projects; Bitbucket's free tier includes branch restrictions; neither currently has this issue).

**Trigger:** Before any free-tier user tries to use the framework in `private` mode. Workaround documented in `docs/builders-guide.md` § Repository Setup.

**Related:** Live-API verification on 2026-04-22. Orphan test repos in user's GitHub account needing manual cleanup.

## BL-003: Full end-to-end init.sh test against mocked host CLIs

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Audit
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

Plan Task 10.1 was deferred during inline execution. Current test coverage: driver-level unit tests (mocked CLIs) and three regression cases (lancache-pattern, missing host field, protection drift). Missing: a "happy path" test that runs `init.sh`'s new `create_and_protect_remote` end-to-end against mocked `gh`/`glab`/`curl` and verifies all post-conditions (manifest host field set, CI template at correct host-specific path, `process-state.json` `phase2_init.steps_completed` populated).

**Scope:** add `tests/host-drivers/e2e-init.test.sh`. For each host (github/gitlab/bitbucket/other), scaffold a minimal init environment, run `create_and_protect_remote`, assert post-state.

**Trigger:** Before refactoring `init.sh`'s host flow; any change there risks silent regression without this test.

## BL-004: Upgrade-path regression test for flat→per-host template migration

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Audit
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

Plan Task 10.3 was deferred during inline execution. `scripts/upgrade-project.sh` now handles two migrations (flat CI templates → per-host subfolders; manifest `host` field backfill) but neither migration has a regression test.

**Scope:** add case to `tests/upgrade-path-tests.sh`. Scaffold a project with old flat `templates/pipelines/ci/*.yml` layout and manifest without `host` field, run upgrade, assert: existing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` preserved, templates moved to `github/` subfolder, `host` field backfilled to `github` (inferred from remote URL), process-state.json NOT auto-verified.

**Trigger:** Before the first downstream project attempts to upgrade to this framework version.

## BL-005: Parity test coverage for GitLab and Bitbucket drivers

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Debt
**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Open

Driver-level test coverage varies: GitHub has 8 scenarios (full contract, both modes, drift cases); GitLab has 6 (most of contract, both modes); Bitbucket has 4 (name, require_cli, register_remote, parse_origin only — HTTP logic untested). Bitbucket's `host_configure_protection` and `host_verify_protection` HTTP calls are validated by code review only.

**Scope:** extend `tests/host-drivers/bitbucket.test.sh` with mock-curl fixtures for: configure_protection (personal + org payloads), verify_protection (all restriction types present → pass; missing restrictions → fail with specific messages), drift detection.

**Trigger:** Before the first solo-orchestrator user tries Bitbucket, OR whenever touching `bitbucket.sh`.

## BL-006: Enforce Build Loop via pre-commit hook (warns-then-blocks)

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Debt
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Open

Surfaced during the lancache project audit. `scripts/process-checklist.sh --start-feature` is advisory — a `feat(...)` commit can land without starting a Build Loop session, and `--record-feature` detects the drift only after the fact (post-commit audit). On lancache, ID1 and ID3 (MVP Cutline items per PRODUCT_MANIFESTO §5) were committed as `feat(init): ...` without going through the Build Loop; the drift was caught only when running `--record-feature` retroactively.

**Scope:** add a pre-commit-gate check that inspects the staged commit message and blocks (or warns-then-blocks on repeat) when a `feat(...)` commit has no corresponding active Build Loop session in `.claude/build-progress.json` OR no matching recorded feature. Needs a design pass to nail down:
- Warns-then-blocks progression semantics (e.g., first warning allowed, second blocks? or always blocks new feat commits without a session?)
- False-positive handling: hotfixes (`fix:`, not `feat:`), refactors, docs-only changes, merge commits, amended commits, squash-merge scenarios
- Escape hatch: is there a sanctioned bypass path for genuine init-era scaffolding (coupled to BL-007's Init vs Build Loop clarification)?
- How to signal "I'm about to commit a feat, start a Build Loop first" vs. existing user flow

**Trigger:** Before another MVP Cutline ID can drift past the Build Loop unnoticed. Coupled with BL-007 (the Init-vs-Build-Loop rule) — these should be designed together since the rule determines what the hook enforces.

**Related:** lancache project Phase 2 audit, 2026-04-22; path-forward decision to use pre-commit (not post-commit) per technical constraint that post-commit hooks cannot block.

## BL-007: Builder's Guide rule — MVP Cutline IDs always require full Build Loop

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Debt
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

Surfaced during the lancache project audit. Builder's Guide §2.0 (Phase 2 Init sub-steps) and §2.1+ (Build Loop) are distinct phases. A developer or AI reading CLAUDE.md can reasonably conclude that init-era feature work (during §2.0 steps 2–10: scaffolding, migrations, CI setup, Docker, backup verification) doesn't need the full Build Loop ceremony — which is exactly what happened on lancache when `feat(init): initial migration + runner` and `feat(init): structlog with correlation-ID propagation` were treated as init scaffolding. Both were actually MVP Cutline IDs (ID1 and ID3) that deserved full Build Loops.

**Scope:** explicit rule in Builder's Guide — "MVP Cutline items (F-IDs and ID-IDs per PRODUCT_MANIFESTO §5) ALWAYS require a full Build Loop, regardless of which Phase 2 sub-step they land in. If Phase 2 Init work (§2.0 steps 2–10) produces a commit that implements a Cutline ID, that commit must go through `--start-feature` → tests → implementation → audit → `--record-feature` just like any §2.1+ work."

Possibly pair with tooling enforcement in BL-006 that cross-references commit messages against a manifest-derived Cutline ID list — but doc-only is the minimum.

**Trigger:** Couple with BL-006 — the doc rule defines what the hook enforces.

## BL-008: Rollback/abort workflow for recorded features and UAT sessions

**Logged:** 2026-04-22
**Category:** Debt
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Open

Surfaced during the lancache project audit. When a feature gets recorded incorrectly (e.g., `--record-feature` called for a commit that shouldn't have been treated as a feature) or a UAT session is started but needs to be aborted, there's no sanctioned workflow. On lancache, the user is about to correct via direct `jq` edit of `build-progress.json` + `--reset uat_session` — workable but undocumented.

**Scope:** add `scripts/process-checklist.sh --unrecord-feature NAME` to cleanly remove a feature from `build-progress.json` (with confirmation prompt); document the existing `--reset uat_session` in CLAUDE.md's Testing & Bug Workflow section; possibly add `--abort-build-loop` if a feature was started but never finished and the orchestrator wants to scrap it without recording.

**Trigger:** Most immediate follow-up of the three — user is doing the manual fix via jq today. Smallest scope (new subcommand + docs); good quick-win to tackle first.

**Related:** lancache project Phase 2 audit, 2026-04-22. Tackling first per path-forward ordering.
